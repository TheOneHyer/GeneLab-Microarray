STUDY
Study Identifier	"GSE10533"
Study Title	"Effects of spaceflight on murine skeletal muscle gene expression"
Study Description	"Spaceflight results in a number of adaptations to skeletal muscle, including atrophy and shifts towards faster muscle fiber types. To identify changes in gene expression that may underlie these adaptations, microarray expression analysis was performed on gastrocnemius from mice flown on the STS-108 shuttle flight (11 days, 19 hours) versus mice maintained on earth for the same period. Additionally, to identify changes that were due to unloading and reloading, microarray analyses were conducted on calf muscle from ground-based mice subjected to hindlimb suspension (12 days) and mice subjected to hindlimb suspension plus a brief period of reloading (3.5 hours) to simulate the time between landing and sacrifice of the spaceflight mice."

Study Protocol Description	"Total RNA was prepared from tissue samples by Trizol extraction followed by purification using RNeasy columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Quality and purity of the RNA preparations were assessed by spectrophotometric determination of A260:A280 ratios and by quantification of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA ratios using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA)."	"Synthesis of double stranded cDNA, in vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA targets and fragmentation of target cRNA were performed as outlined by Affymetrix protocols."	"Fragmented cRNA samples were hybridized overnight at 45C in a GeneChip hybridization oven 640. Post hybridization washing and phycoerythrin-streptavidin staining were performed in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 using established Affymetrix protocols."	"GeneChips were scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000, two passes"	"Expression values were calculated using RMA; detection calls were calculated using MAS5"	"All animals were housed individually in animal enclosure modules [AEM; developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (Moffett Field, CA)] with access to food and water ad libitum. The muscles used in the spaceflight study came from the same mice as those previously described (12, 14, 30): female C57BL/6J mice were divided into AEM ground controls and spaceflight (SF) groups. Animals were maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with all animal care, treatment, and housing density within National Institutes of Health guidelines."	"SF animals were flown on the middeck of the space shuttle Endeavour (STS-108/UF-1) for 11 days and 19 h beginning December 5, 2001. AEM animals were housed at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Hangar L orbital environmental simulator for 11 days and 19 h with conditions mimicking the shuttle's middeck temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels.

For the ground-based unloading/reloading studies, mice were divided into three groups (n = 5/group): control, suspension, and suspension plus reloading. he suspension animals were killed while suspended at the end of the 12 days. Suspended mice were unsuspended for 3.5 h at the end of the 12 days of suspension and allowed to engage in normal loading for this period to match the time between landing and death for the STS-108 mice. 

All animals were 77 days of age at the time of death. Tissues were dissected and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen."	"The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.
